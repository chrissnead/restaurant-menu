#Project 2

This program simulates an online restaurant, where users can choose between the “breakfast menu” the “lunch menu” or the “dinner menu” and then choose food items to purchase from one of these menus. Although this program works successfully when using proper inputs, the project did not ask for error checking, therefore cannot be considered "finished". This project is here only to showcase what I have learned and how I have developed.
